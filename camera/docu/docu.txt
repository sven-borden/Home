This tcpserver for the esp32-cam AI-thinkerboard is using the lwip directly via BSD Socket API.
esp_http_server is not used.

After reset the bootup will stop for 2 seconds at message "+++LoginEdit+++".
If you hit the SPACE key at this point you will enter an interactive function to enter/edit Wifi credentials which are saved in NVS (eeprom).
You obviouly need to be connected with a terminal (putty) to the serial port at 8N1, 115200.

During bootup the red little debugLED will be lit until a successful wifi connection has been established.
This way you can check, if camera is connected and running.(Led not lit)

The default camera parameters after reset are:  640*480 at reduced 8 frames per second, jpg quality=10.

linux motion:
i added some sample config files in "linux-motion".
you can specify a mask file for your camera.
the fileformat has to be .pgm and shall only contain black and white areas.
black areas are discarded for motion detection.
only white areas are being considered.

take a snapshot with your cam, then edit with gimp.
select  area(s) to be discarded an fill it with black. fill the rest with white.
Finally file->export as....pgm. done
